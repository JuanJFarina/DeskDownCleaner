# DeskDownCleaner
A Windows Batch Script for cleaning the Desktop and Downloads folders by moving its folders into "Ordenar", moving any file inside its relevant folder (music files, video files, image files, document files), and then deleting any leftover files (like old installation files or other temporary files we may never need).
